Dear Sir/Madam,

Re: Applying for  Mobile/ Cloud Apps Developer (co-op Placement(January-2015) 

I would like to apply for the  Mobile/ Cloud Apps Developer   position that I come to know from my co-op officer.  This position sounds exactly the same which I am looking for. 

As you will notice from the enclosed resume, I have programming experience of 4 years in Java and also have good knowledge of ajax,jquery,javascript,html,css . I worked in highly technical environment(CMMI level 5) in product development and product life-cycle management.  According to your advertisement about this position require programming experience and knowledge of ios, android and cross mobile platform frameworks. Fortunately, all of these skills I had experienced in my current academic course so I believe that I have the appropriate qualifications for this position. I am fast learner too that helps  me to learn new technologies and stay updated .

I hope you would consider my application favorably and grant me an interview in your earliest convenience. Thanks for your valuable time.
